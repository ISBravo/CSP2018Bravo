  <p style="background-color:SlateBlue;font-size:150%;color:white"> My name is Omar Bravo and I am a student at STEM Early College High School. I am in my senior year and am on track to graduate with my associates degree in science focused in Engineering. I enjoy playing video games non competatively. I am currently playing Nier: Automata alone. I also love cats and hope to adopt a cat in the future.
